QTP - QR Transport Protocol
============================

QTP is a "protocol" designed to transmit arbitrary data over a stream of QR images. This approach allows
for a multicast type of data transmission without traditional networking equipment.

This project was created during HackPrinceton 2013. It earned the Hacks for Humanity prize, but I also
created this project when I had really no idea how to use git.
